# Arduino_STM32F4_Discovery

## What?
The [STM32F4 Discovery](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html) is a development board with an ARM microcontrolller from STM which is very suitable for audio applications.
Now it is possible to program it with the Arduino-IDE if you have installed the plugins.

##Why
Programming the STM32F407 microcontroller is usually very complicated if you are using the common deveoper IDEs and frameworks.
With Arduino-IDE it is now possible for every one.

## Demo Applications
- playing sound 
- using the accelerometer
- controlling the sound with the accelerometer

##Installation

You have to install the [STM32GENERIC framework](https://github.com/danieleff/STM32GENERIC).

The installatiion instructions you will [find here](https://danieleff.github.io/STM32GENERIC/).
